  caveats <<~EOS
    DbRover isn't notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks its first launch with
    "Apple could not verify DbRover". Open System Settings > Privacy & Security,
    scroll down to the message about DbRover and click Open Anyway.

    Or, if you trust this download, remove the quarantine flag before opening it:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/DbRover.app"

    DbRover updates itself from then on, so `brew upgrade` leaves it alone.
